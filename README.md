Welcome to the Cancer Detection Web App repository! This project utilizes machine learning models to detect both lung and breast cancer, providing a user-friendly interface through a Flask-based web application.

## Features

-Dual Cancer Detection: Our project incorporates machine learning models trained to detect both lung and breast cancer.
-Web Interface: Utilizing Flask, we've developed a sleek and intuitive web application for easy access to the cancer detection models.
-Efficient Diagnosis: With the power of AI, our models enable efficient and accurate diagnosis, potentially aiding in early detection and treatment.

## Usage

-Clone the repository to your local machine.
-Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
-Run the Flask app by executing python app.py.
-Access the web application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
-Upload relevant medical images for cancer detection and follow the on-screen instructions.
